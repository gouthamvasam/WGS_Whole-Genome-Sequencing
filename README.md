A general workflow for analyzing Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) data starting from FASTQ files:

1. **Raw Data Quality Control**: Evaluate the quality of the raw FASTQ files using tools such as FastQC to ensure data integrity before proceeding with further analysis.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Process the raw data to remove sequencing adapters, filter out low-quality reads, and trim sequences as necessary to prepare for accurate alignment. Tools like Cutadapt and Trimmomatic are commonly utilized for these tasks.

3. **Sequence Alignment**: BWA and Bowtie2 are appropriate choices for aligning WGS data. For human data, BWA-MEM is often the preferred algorithm.

4. **Post-alignment Processing**: Perform post-alignment optimizations including marking duplicate reads, realigning reads around potential indels to improve variant calling accuracy, and recalibrating base quality scores to correct systematic errors made by the sequencer. The Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) provides a suite of tools commonly used for these processes.

5. **Variant Calling**: Detect variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions/deletions (indels) from the aligned reads. Variant callers like GATK's HaplotypeCaller or FreeBayes are equipped to handle this step, producing a list of variant calls typically in VCF (Variant Call Format) files. GATK's HaplotypeCaller is a common choice for calling SNPs and indels in WGS data. FreeBayes is another option, especially for non-human data or when working with polyploid genomes

6. **Variant Annotation and Filtering**: Enhance the variant calls with detailed information about their predicted effects on genes, proteins, and regulation, and apply filtering criteria to prioritize variants of interest while removing common or benign variants. Annotation tools such as ANNOVAR, SnpEff, or the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) are employed to provide this context to the variant data.

7. **Advanced Analyses**: Depending on your research interest, you might want to perform other advanced analyses such as phylogenetic analysis, comparative genomics, metagenomics, etc.
